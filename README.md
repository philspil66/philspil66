I'm a Software Polyglot 💾 Full Stack Developer 🖥️ Music Lover! 🎸 and Music Maker! 🎵 and have worked with many great Tech Companies for 30+ years as well as building my own businesses which have generated over $2.5 million in sales.

Code wise I started out back in 1981 using BASIC, and progressed to COBOL and used many variations of that. From there I became a Java Developer, and then moved into .NET using C#, VB.NET, classic ASP etc, I then moved into mobile development coding with Android and Apple Objective-C. Also worked with PHP using Laravel and Symfony, and have used Python, a bit of Golang and lots of front end JS frameworks. I've basically done a bunch of stuff 😉

### 💾 About Me

A techie at heart, I’ve been building software since I was a teenager from back in the early days of Home & Personal Computing, and love inventing and building tools that people love to use which generate real commercial value and ROI.

I also love building Micro-SaaS and side-businesses - helps keep the bank full and the bills paid!

I've worked in many sectors over the years for people such as:
NHS, Department of Health, Pen Test Partners, Ryder Plc, Ministry of Defence, Wincanton, Marks and Spencer's (UK & China), Orange, Waitrose, Karstadt (Germany/Europe), Bass Pro Stores (USA), DSG International (Dixons, The Link), 3663, Unipart, Budgens, BWG Spa, Event Support Team Ltd, IAW Resources.

I'm currently doing some work in the Cyber-Security 🔒 sector with [Pen Test Partners](https://www.pentestpartners.com/) and also building my own Marketing-Tech products such as [zubbit.io](https://zubbit.io) 🚀 and dabbling with some music projects 🎹 🎵 and writing a book 📚 so quite busy!

Outside of coding I'm a massive 🎸 music fan and have been hitting the gig scene for over 30 years, going to see anything from Andy Williams live to Napalm Death on the other end of the scale. I like a lot of different sorts and genre's of music for sure! 

I'm not a natural musician myself but like playing with Albelton and hope that something nice sounding will come out of it one day that's worth loading up to Soundcloud. 


### ⚡ My Github

On my Github you will find lots of fun stuff. I do collect lots of old legacy code, especially vintage gaming software, and I'm also writing some games, both recreating some classic old-skool games but also planning to write some new games. So check out my repos! All a bit of a work in progress so do ping me if you have any questions.
