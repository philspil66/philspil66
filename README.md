## Hey, I'm Phil

I'm a Software Polyglot 💾 Full Stack Developer 🖥️ Music Lover! 🎸 and Music Maker! 🎵 and have worked with many great Tech Companies for 30+ years as well as building my own businesses which have generated over $2.5 million in sales.

### About Me

A techie at heart, I’ve been building software since I was a teenager from back in the early days of Home & Personal Computing, and love inventing and building tools that people love to use which generate real commercial value and ROI.

I love building Micro-SaaS and side-businesses.

I've worked in many sectors over the years for people such as:
NHS, Department of Health, Pen Test Partners, Ryder Plc, Ministry of Defence, Wincanton, Marks and Spencer's (UK & China), Orange, Waitrose, Karstadt (Germany/Europe), Bass Pro Stores (USA), DSG International (Dixons, The Link), 3663, Unipart, Budgens, BWG Spa, Event Support Team Ltd, IAW Resources.

I'm currently doing some work in the Cyber-Security 🔒 sector with [Pen Test Partners](https://www.pentestpartners.com/) and also building my own Marketing-Tech products such as [zubbit.io](https://zubbit.io) 🚀 (worth checking this one out 😉), Power Traffic X, and dabbling with some music projects 🎹 🎵 and writing a book 📚 so quite busy!

### ⚡ My Github

On my Github you will find lots of fun stuff. I do collect lots of old legacy code, especially vintage gaming software, and I'm also writing some games, both recreating some classic old-skool games but also planning to write some new games. So check out my repos! All a bit of a work in progress so do ping me if you have any questions.
